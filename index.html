<h1>ACML2023 Workshop: New Horizons of Online Learning</h1>

Date: 2023.11.11 Afternoon
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The literature on online learning has been extensively studied over decades, 
and now we have profound foundations such as online convex optimization and bandit algorithms. 
Recent developments of AI in related fields provide us with new challenging problems such as multi-objective online optimization, online non-convex optimization, distributed online optimization, and so on, which the standard online learning frameworks might only partially capture.
In this workshop, we focus on (but not limited to) the following topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Online decision problems that might not be categorized as standard problems of, e.g., online convex optimization or bandit problems.
<li>Alternative formulations (such as Blackwell games) and reductions between alternative and standard formulations.
<li>New applications of online decision-making. In particular, we welcome new applications motivating new formulations of online decision-making.
<li>Other emerging topics in online learning (e.g., adaptive algorithms that work in both stochastic and adversarial environments).
</ul>
