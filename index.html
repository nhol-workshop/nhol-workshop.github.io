<h1>ACML2023 Workshop: New Horizons of Online Learning</h1>

Date: 11th November 2023 13:30-18:00
<hr>
<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Call for contributed talks is announced (deadline: 10th October).</li>   
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The literature on online learning has been extensively studied over decades, 
and now we have profound foundations such as online convex optimization and bandit algorithms. 
Recent developments of AI in related fields provide us with new challenging problems such as multi-objective online optimization, online non-convex optimization, distributed online optimization, and so on, which the standard online learning frameworks might only partially capture.
In this workshop, we focus on (but not limited to) the following topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Online decision problems that might not be categorized as standard problems of, e.g., online convex optimization or bandit problems.
<li>Alternative formulations (such as Blackwell games) and reductions between alternative and standard formulations.
<li>New applications of online decision-making. In particular, we welcome new applications motivating new formulations of online decision-making.
<li>Other emerging topics in online learning (e.g., adaptive algorithms that work in both stochastic and adversarial environments).
</ul>

<h2>Invited Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shinji Ito (NEC)
<li>Koji Tabata (Hokkaido Univ.)
<li>Yaxiong Liu (Hokkaido Univ./RIKEN AIP) 
</ul>

<h2>Call for Contributed Talks</h2>
<p>
We call for contributed talks on the above-listed topics. 
To encourage stimulating discussions, we also welcome talks on recent previous 
but original work related to the scope of the workshop (i.e., we allow talk proposals based
on previously published original work). 
Instead, we will not publish any proceedings (but may share abstracts only with participants) 
and will not treat contributed talks as formal publications.
</p>
<p><b>Submission Instruction: </b>
Please E-mail to nhol.workshop@gmail.com with subject line ACML23-NHOL-{paper name} 
with the following contents.
<ul>
<li>If the result is openly published (or in arXiv), include the URL.
<li>Otherwise, attach short abstract or published paper or manuscript (any format is ok, but short abstract is at least 1 page long).
<li>Indicating attending face-to-face or online (face-to-face attendance is highly recommended)
</ul>
<b>Deadline: 10th October (AoE).</b><br>
<b>Notification: 16th October (AoE).</b>
